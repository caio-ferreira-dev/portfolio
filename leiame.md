This is my personal portfolio built with React, Vite, and TypeScript, designed to showcase my professional background, technical skills, and relevant projects. The site was developed as a Single Page Application (SPA), with a focus on performance, responsiveness, and smooth navigation. The entire structure was crafted to highlight my work as a developer, with a strong emphasis on the JavaScript ecosystem.
